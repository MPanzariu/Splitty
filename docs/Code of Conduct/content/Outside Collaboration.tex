\section{Outside Collaboration}It is expected that each week, at 14:45 the team members will meet at flux hall to discuss final thoughts before the scheduled TA meeting every Tuesday, unless the team members have collectively decided to not hold the meeting. The purpose of these meetings is to ensure that all the members are up to date and voice any issues or ideas that they have about the project. \par

Additionally, a weekly vote will be conducted to decide if an additional group meeting is to be held in Discord. In the case that one is to be held, the date and time will be agreed on and posted on WhatsApp/Discord. The vote can be conducted either in person during another meeting, or digitally in WhatsApp or Discord. During these meetings we resolve left-over problems of the week.\par
