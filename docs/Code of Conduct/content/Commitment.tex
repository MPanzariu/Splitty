\section{Commitment}
Commitment is gauged by code and teamwork contributions, with the quality of group work and the commitment of the chair/minute taker evaluated during Tuesday TA meetings, within code reviews, and through ongoing \textbf{Communication} (see relevant section) channels.\par
The quality of work of the team as a whole is determined by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Code Quality
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The GitLab build pipeline on the main branch passing
        \item Fulfillment of user stories and requirements
        \item Elimination of bugs and unintended behavior
        \item High-coverage (ideally 80\%) automated unit \& integration testing being present
        \item JavaDoc documentation written for all relevant methods
        \item The ability of each team member to read, understand, and explain a given code fragment
        \item Proper principles from the \textbf{Assignment Description} section (e.g. dependency injection) being applied throughout the codebase
        % \item Little to no CheckStyle warnings, using the agreed-upon set of CheckStyle rules
        % \item Little to no compiler warnings
        \item Uniform code style
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Coordination
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A usable deliverable being available for demonstration at the end of each sprint
        \item Submissions being made in a timely manner
        \item Code reviews being submitted at most 2 days after a Merge Request is created
        \item Use of GitLab issues to divide and plan tasks
        \item The sprint schedule being expedient enough to complete the \textbf{Target Ambition Level} (see section) in the allotted time frame
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}\par
The quality of a specific team member’s work is determined by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Code Quality
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The GitLab build pipeline on a member’s feature branch passing, if the branch’s Merge Request is finalized and awaiting approval
        \item Fulfillment of assigned requirements
        \item Elimination of bugs and unintended behavior in code before merging, and if more are discovered later, within under a week of discovery
        \item High-coverage (ideally 80\%) automated unit/integration testing on each feature branch
        \item JavaDoc documentation written for all relevant methods on
        % \item Ability to explain code submitted
        \item Proper principles from the \textbf{Assignment Description} section (e.g. dependency injection) being applied
        \item Little to no CheckStyle warnings, using the agreed-upon set of CheckStyle rules
        \item Little to no compiler warnings
        \item Code style similar to team’s as a whole
        \item Code fitting in with others’ contributions in terms of architecture and strategy
        \item Knockout Criteria being fulfilled
        % \begin{enumerate}
        %     \item 100+ lines of Java code per week
        %     \item 3+ commits per week
        %     \item 1 merge request per week
        % \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Coordination
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Submissions being made in a timely manner, to allow others to review them
        % \item Reviewing and approving at least one other member’s Merge Request per week
        \item Providing helpful and constructive comments on merge Requests
        \item Creation and assigning of GitLab issues to themselves
        % \item Spending as many hours per week on the project as is stated in the \textbf{OOPP Course Schedule}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
The commitment of the chair is determined by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Submission and merging of the week’s agenda before Sunday 23:59 PM.
    \item The agenda tackling all important talking points for the week.
    % \item A lack of moments of silence where no meeting participant knows what to do next
\end{enumerate}
The commitment of the minute taker is determined by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Minutes containing all relevant meeting decisions
    \item The previous week’s minutes being submitted prior to the current week’s meeting
\end{enumerate}
