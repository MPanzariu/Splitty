\section{Consequences}
General predispositions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The goal is focusing on prevention and not having to resort to consequences to solve conflicts;
    \item These consequences are only meant to continuously improve our collaboration and the workflow of the project;
    \item None of the consequences should have an impact on the personâ€™s wellbeing;
\end{enumerate}
Consequences related to meetings and work sessions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consequences related to the private meetings:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item It is acceptable that members notify no later than 30 minutes before the meeting if unforeseen circumstances occur;
        \item If a person misses meetings/is constantly late but a notice has been received we will hold a discussion to figure a possible solution;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Consequences related to the official meetings:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If a person is constantly (more than twice) late (more than 5-10 minutes) the team will reach the member to see why this might be and suggest arriving earlier for the lab session;
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Consequences related to tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If a person does not finish all assigned tasks which had significant relevance to the development of the project, they will:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Receive a heads up if it happens once;
        \item Have to reasonably motivate why they were not able to do the task/tasks if it happens twice;
        \item Have to assist in a serious discussion as to why they were unable to do so if it happens more than three times; the discussion is aimed at finding solutions for the inactivity;
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Consequences related to behavior:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Discriminant behavior is not tolerated in any form;
    \item If a person makes inappropriate remarks regarding any other member they will be notified and asked not to repeat such behavior:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If the behavior is repeated to an extent where it is out of the control of the team, the TA will be notified;
        \item If the person clearly has bad intentions or continues to disturb the activity of the project; a formally written message will be sent to the board of the course;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item If a person physically harms any other team member, a formally written message will be sent to the board of the course;
\end{enumerate}
Other consequences:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the assigned chairs/minute takers can not for any reason fulfill their duty during the meeting they may notify the team in a timely manner and take up the position in a future meeting if possible;
\item Other potential actions which may require consequences and were not specifically mentioned above will follow the consequences in ranging magnitude: notification from the team members -> discussion with the team members -> discussion with the TA -> letter to the board of the course;
\end{enumerate}
