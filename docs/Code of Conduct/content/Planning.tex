\section{Planning}
External planning:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Meetings and work sessions
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Official meetings on Tuesdays are expected to last up to 45 minutes:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Circularly, a chair and minute taker will be assigned;
        \item Important matters like the status of the project and division of tasks take place during the meeting;
        \item Issues related to the project will be brought up to the TA;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Lab hours before and after the official meeting will be used for discussion;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Organization
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Most of our activity will be tracked on GitLab:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item All tasks will be attributed through the issues tab in GitLab, where each member assigns themselves tasks;
        \item All agendas for the official meetings and minutes will be recorded on GitLab;
        \item If available, minutes for the unofficial meetings will be uploaded to the GitLab repository;
        \item Feedback will be provided through comments under merge requests;
        \item General questions about the project and other suggestions may also be resolved through GitLab, in favor of internal communication channels;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Other less important but still relevant chats and discussions may take place on Mattermost;
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Internal planning:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Meetings and work sessions outside of the mandatory sessions
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item A weekly meeting is expected for maintaining a clear overview of the current status. During these meetings we will discuss future planning, assign tasks and share updates:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A universally available online platform/location will be selected;
        \item All members are expected to attend;
        \item A shortlist and potential minute of each meeting will be uploaded to Gitlab;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Private meetings either online or in person can be organized between members if agreed;
    \item According to the division of tasks, the rest of the work which is classified as individual is up to the assigned person to work on whenever they see fit. The individual progress will be tracked in accordance to the internal planning;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Task and time management
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Based on the desired outcome of the project, an appropriate general expectation will be met by each member. This can be verified through the means of communication or during meetings;
    \item Having taken into consideration the common goal, the tasks and planning will be conceived accordingly;
    \item Ensure each member finishes their assigned tasks on time through regular check-ins:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item On the WhatsApp group;
        \item In person during the lab hours;
        \item During our private meetings;
        \item During the official meetings;
        \item In private on Gitlab, following the commits, merge requests, issue tab and general activity;
        \item On Mattermost;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The tasks will be divided equally such that no discrepancies are observed;
    \item It is expected that all issues assigned for a current week are finished before Sunday at 23:59 CET;
    \item The exact division of tasks will not be strict; If spontaneous tasks appear, they will be documented on GitLab through the merge requests;
    \item Task division will be discussed during meetings or on platforms accessible to all to ensure each person gets assigned the correct task;
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
