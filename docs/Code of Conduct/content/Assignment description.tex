    \end{enumerate}
    \item Distribute the workload evenly and fairly by:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Creating concrete tasks based on the requirements document
        \item Using GitLab tools like Issues to assign and manage them
        \item Communicating (see \textbf{Communication} section) to collaboratively decide on task assignment
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Collaborate in a formal capacity by:
    \begin{enumerate}
