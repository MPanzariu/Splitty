\section{Target Ambition Level}
After revision and according to group consensus, we believe an 8/10 is achievable. The team is not only concerned about the completion of the project, but also places emphasis on thorough planning, comprehensive code contributions, and thoughtful code reviews to ensure the integrity and quality of our work.

Each team member strives for continuous improvement based on the feedback that he receives during a team meeting or from the teaching assistant that is responsible for the team. In the event it becomes increasingly obvious that this level of effort is too ambitious and unachievable in the time left, either due to a heavy workload or a team member feels the need for a change of the ambition level for any reason, it must be discussed and voted on during a team meeting.
